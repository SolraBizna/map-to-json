This is a plugin for [Weland](https://github.com/treellama/weland), the Aleph One map editor. It allows exporting an entire Marathon level into JSON format, for ingestion by other tools. (No import of JSON data for now.)

# Usage

Put `MapToJSON.dll` and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` into your Weland plugins folder, and "Map To JSON" will appear in the Plugins menu.

# Building

Acquire `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` (for .NET 4.0) and put it in the same folder as the Makefile. Run `make`. Your brand-new `MapToJSON.dll` will appear in the `bin` folder.
